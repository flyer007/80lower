# 80lower
Summary: Machining a lower receiver is like any other part; essentially all you need is to locate 3 positions for your
CNC in order for it to run your program. These three locations are called your X, Y, & Z coordinates. The X & Y coordinateis located using an edge finder, and the Z coordinate is located with your cutting tool. Once you find each coordinate you
“zero” out the value for that coordinate on your machine, and then you load your program and run it.
